# UZ's Hideous Destructor Addon

This is my personal collection of recolor/resprite/resound assets for the GZDoom gameplay mod, "Hideous Destructor".  As it's my personal collection of changes, there are several various mods it makes changes to.

Credits:

- Matt, for creating Hideous Destructor itself, including the Brontornis HUD Sprites as well as the default ironsight sprites
- PrettyFist, for the Greely pickup & HUD sprites
- AdianoTMO69, for the Shortened version of PrettyFist's Greely HUD sprites
- HexaDoken, for the Boss Variants' ironsight & HUD sprites
- Icarus, for modified versions of Sonik.O/Railgunner Original Six12 sprites
- Swampyrad, for the Obrozz HUD sprites

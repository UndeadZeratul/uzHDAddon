### Weapon Sprite Changes
_Note: Some weapons included have the crosshair color "baked" into the sprite, and for those weapons I have taken the liberty of tweaking the in-game sprite to match my personal crosshair color.  If you would like your crosshair color to match, simply update the color in the main GZDoom options menu to `#673ab7`_

_Requires [Radtech Weapons Pack](https://github.com/swampyrad/RadTechWeaponsPack)_

# UZ's Hideous Destructor Addon

This is my personal collection of recolor/resprite/resound assets for the GZDoom gameplay mod, "Hideous Destructor".  As it's my personal collection of changes, there are several various mods it makes changes to.

---
## Sprite Changes

### Recolored Ironsights

#### Vanilla Hideous Destructor
- Default Hideous Destructor Front & Back Ironsights

#### Peppergrinder
- HLAR 9mm AR Front Ironsight
- BPX 9mm Carbine Rifle Back Ironsight
- Sig-Cow 10mm Carbine Rifle Back Ironsight
- TRO-G AR Front Ironsight

### Weapon Sprite Changes
_Note: Some weapons included have the crosshair color "baked" into the sprite, and for those weapons I have taken the liberty of tweaking the in-game sprite to match my personal crosshair color.  If you would like your crosshair color to match, simply update the color in the main GZDoom options menu to `#673ab7`_

#### Pistols
_Requires [Radtech Weapons Pack](https://github.com/swampyrad/RadTechWeaponsPack)_

The pistol has been swapped out with Glock18 sprites, then recolored to match thematically.  The "Quick Swap" set of sprites have the pistol correctly flipped, as well.

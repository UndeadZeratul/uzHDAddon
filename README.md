This is my personal collection of recolor/resprite/resound assets for the GZDoom gameplay mod, "Hideous Destructor".  As it's my personal collection of changes, there are several various mods it makes changes to.

## Sprite Changes

### Weapon Sprite Changes
_Note: Some weapons included have the crosshair color "baked" into the sprite, and for those weapons I have taken the liberty of tweaking the in-game sprite to match my personal crosshair color.  If you would like your crosshair color to match, simply update the color in the main GZDoom options menu to `#673ab7`_

## Special Thanks

- Matt, for creating Hideous Destructor itself
- Dizzy, for giving me the inspiration to make my own HDest Addon
- All of those who created the assets used in this pack.
	- Image credits have been listed under their respective screenshots

### DRLA Credits
_Assets used from [DRLA](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=37044) have been done so with permission.  
**PERMISSION FROM DRLA AUTHORS IS REQUIRED TO RE-USE THEM**_

- **SoloSpaghetti**, for the Bulletproof Vest sprite (Sneaking Suit), the Tactical Armor sprite (Garrison Armor), and the Western Armor sprite (Leather Jacket)  

### UNKNOWN CREDITS
_I've tried finding the original owner for these assets and have come up empty.  
If you are or know the owner, please let me know to correct them._

- Various Hands sprites, including the unarmed Fist sprites, came from the [Master Hand Sheet](https://imgur.com/FIYBDSI), and thus I'm not sure who did these specific alternative punching sprites.
- The Plasma Pistol HUD & pickup sprites (Phazer).  These were taken from DRLA, but I have been informed they were not made for DRLA and the original ownership has been lost.
